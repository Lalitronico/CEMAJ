# Frontend Design Skill

**Name**: frontend-design
**Description**: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Purpose

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

**Context**: The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian
   - Or many other flavors

   Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Critical Principle

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is **intentionality, not intensity**.

### Implementation Requirements

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on these key areas:

### 1. Typography
- Choose fonts that are **beautiful, unique, and interesting**
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Opt for **distinctive, characterful font choices** that elevate the frontend's aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### 2. Color & Theme
- Commit to a **cohesive aesthetic**
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- **Dominant colors with sharp accents** outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### 3. Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- **Focus on high-impact moments**: One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### 4. Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### 5. Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create **atmosphere and depth** rather than defaulting to solid colors
- Add contextual effects and textures matching the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative forms:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise textures
  - Geometric patterns
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders
  - Custom cursors
  - Grain overlays

## What to NEVER Do

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- **Overused font families**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- **Predictable layouts** and component patterns
- **Cookie-cutter design** that lacks context-specific character

### Variation Principle

Interpret creatively and make **unexpected choices** that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between:
- Light and dark themes
- Different fonts
- Different aesthetics
- **NEVER converge** on common choices (e.g., Space Grotesk) across generations

## Implementation Complexity Matching

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist or refined designs** need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- **Elegance comes from executing the vision well**

## Final Principle

> Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
